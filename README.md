# AO3 Enhancer

Firefox extension for the fanfiction website [ArchiveOfOurOwn](http://archiveofourown.org/).

## Installing

WIP!

## Features

Most features are disabled by default. Please click on the extension icon to enable features in the options menu.

### Enhancer Additions

**Kudos to Hit Ratio**: Adds a kudos to hit percentage to the stats list of a work.

### Filtering Settings

Automatically modifies AO3 urls, using the archive's built-in filter to:

- **Exclude tags/fandoms** - Exclude works with specific tags/fandoms.
- **Exclude archive warnings** - Exclude selected warnings.
- **Select a default language** - Only works of a selected language will be displayed.
- **Search within results** - Apply a supplied query.
